### Aditya Nair, Gilad Silberberg<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

SilberReconstructor is a program implemented within *Mathematica* Version 10.3 <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> for the automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology in three dimensional z stack confocal microscope images. Created for the biologist, it features an easy to use user interface and can give robust results without extensive domain knowledge in image processing.

## Downloading SilberReconstructor

> SilberReconstructor can be downloaded from the following Git repository: [SilberReconstructor-Git](https://adityanairneuro.github.io/silver-reconstructor/)

## Using SilberReconstructor

>SilberReconstructor takes in three dimensional fluorescence microscopy images of neurobiotin filled neurons and applies pre-processing algorithms to remove the common sources of noise such as non-specific staining and neurobiotin leakage. It performs reconstruction using the APP1 or APP2 algorithms (Peng et al., 2011, Xiao et al., 2013) called from the Vaa3D platform (Peng et al., 2014). Post processing can be performed natively within SilberReconstructor or can be performed by calling the open source program NeuTube (Feng et al., 2015). 

# Ease of Use 

>SilberReconstructor acts as a pipeline that allows for the complete automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology. It presents a simple to use interface that allows users to proceed with analysis without any domain-specific knowledge in image processing.
