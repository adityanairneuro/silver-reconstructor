	<h1>SilberReconstructor, A hub for the automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology</h1>
	<h2>Aditya Nair, Gilad Silberberg</h2>
	<p>This website describes the working and use of SilberReconstructor, a hub for the automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology.</p><hr>
	
	<p>SilberReconstructor is an image processing hub developed in the language <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/">Wolfram Mathematica</a>.<br> Its current applications include the automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology in third dimensional fluorescence confocal microscope images.</p>
	<p>As SilberReconstructor uses Wolfram Mathematica to perform its computations, this software must first be installed for AdCount to be functional.<br>
	</p>
	<p>SilberReconstructor uses the popular APP2 and APP1 reconstruction algorithms (Peng et al., 2011, Xiao et al., 2013) from the Vaa3D platform (Peng et al., 2014), combining it with pre-processing algorithms written in Mathematica that specifically targets the types of noise seens in confocal images. In addition to this, SilberReconstructor also performs several post processing fucntions, thus acting as a good companion program to Vaa3D with its reconstruction algorithms</p><hr>
