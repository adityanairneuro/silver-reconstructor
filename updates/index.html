	<h2>Aditya Nair, Gilad Silberberg</h2>
	<p>This website describes the working and use of SilberReconstructor, a hub for the automated reconstruction of neuronal morphology..</p> <hr>
	
	<h1>Current Version</h1> 
        <h2>SilberReconstructor 1.0</h2>
	<p>This version can perform automated reconstruction of neurons in three dimensional z stack confocal microscopy images.</p>
        <h2>SilberReconstructor 1.1</h2>
	<p>This version adds batch processing of multiple neurons simultaneously. It also aloows for some SWC editing such as flipping of SWC files (required to correct the change in orientation that APP2 induces)</p>
	
	<h1>Upcoming Versions</h1>
	<p>The next version will feature the ability to analyze morphology reconstructed by quantifying several features such neurite lenght, dendritic spine density etc</p>
